Your appâ€™s name: 

"Get your fit on!!" is my app's name and the functionality involves logging exercise workout routines so that the user can collect and remember for each workout they decide to implement.
It is mainly for HIIT workouts and has the functionality to create, edit and update names and descriptions of the exercises. I built this app so that in the future I can create different combinations of HIIT workouts. 

Getting started: Include a link to your deployed app and a link to your planning materials.

Wins: Full CRUD functionality. 



Next steps: Planned future enhancements (stretch goals).
Future enhancements may involve adding a favorites feature whereby users can favorite the ones they particularly find effective or enjoy. 
I would also like to dynamically put in different photos on the show page for each exercise. 
This may then evolve to a videos feature where you can upload videos of each exercise demonstration. 
A profile page for this would also be a good addition so that there are lists of each workout combinations.
